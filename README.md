# low_light_image_enhancement
his project focuses on enhancing images captured in low-light conditions using a deep learning-based approach. We combine the strengths of LeNet for feature extraction and U-Net for image-to-image translation, resulting in a powerful model that improves image brightness, clarity, and detail without introducing artifacts.

ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights
LeNet is used for learning essential features from low-light images.

U-Net architecture is employed for enhancing image quality through pixel-level restoration.

The model is trained on paired datasets of low-light and normal-light images.

Objective: Improve visual quality while preserving natural textures and colors.

ðŸš€ Applications
Surveillance camera footage enhancement

Medical imaging preprocessing

Night photography post-processing

Autonomous vehicles operating in dark environments

#Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch, if applicable)

OpenCV

NumPy, Matplotlib
